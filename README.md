# ğŸ“¦ Research and optimization of delivery processes based on the analysis of logistic data

This project combines theory and practice to explore how **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** can optimize logistics operations. It focuses on improving delivery time and cost predictions using real-world data from **Regal Export LLP**.

## ğŸ§  Abstract

This thesis explores the growing role of analytics in logistics, focusing on how data science techniques â€” such as **data visualization**, **correlation analysis**, and **predictive modeling** â€” can improve logistics efficiency. The practical component involves building models that predict delivery **costs** and **times** based on historical data. These models use algorithms like **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Neural Networks**, with the best results achieved using Random Forest.
