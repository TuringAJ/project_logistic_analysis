## 🧠 Abstract

This thesis explores the growing role of analytics in logistics, focusing on how data science techniques — such as **data visualization**, **correlation analysis**, and **predictive modeling** — can improve logistics efficiency. The practical component involves building models that predict delivery **costs** and **times** based on historical data. These models use algorithms like **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Neural Networks**, with the best results achieved using Random Forest.
